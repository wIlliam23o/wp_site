<!-- Basic Description -->
<div class='wp-block feature-list'>
	<p id='description'>
	A freedesktop.org menu editor designed for <strong>Linux</strong> desktop
	 environments such as <strong>Gnome, XFCE, LXDE, Cinnamon, & KDE</strong>.
	 Created with <strong>Python 2.7, GTK 2, & Glade 3</strong>. <strong>Menu
	 Props</strong> allows you to view, create, delete, and modify launcher files
	 (<span class='I'>.desktop</span>), directory files
	 (<span class='I'>.directory</span>), and menu files
	 (<span class='I'>.menu</span>).
	</p>

	<!-- Menu Section -->
	<p id='menusection'>
	There are two main sections in <strong>Menu Props</strong>, the first is called
	 the 'Menu' section. This is where you can view the 'menu tree' and modify it's
	 structure and/or contents. This section is very similar to 'alacarte-style' menu
	 editing, except has more features and options. <strong>Menu Props</strong> has a
	 built-in properties editor for launchers and directories, and does not require
	 an external command such as 'desktop-file-edit' to make basic changes. You can
	 still choose to open items in an external editor using the context-menu
	 (<span style="font-style: italic;">right-click</span>) if you like. The default
	 external editor can be changed in "Settings".
	</p>

	<!-- Items section -->
	<p id='itemssection'>
	The 'Items' section lists all launcher/directory files that are found in the
	 default XDG directories, and any other directory found in the XDG_DATA_DIRS
	 environment variable. This allows you to make changes to items that may not be
	 loaded in the menu tree. The 'Items' section is split into 'Entries', 'Dirs',
	 and 'Search'. Here you can find all launchers or directories listed in order by
	 name, and search both lists.
	</p>

	<!-- Search section -->
	<p id='searchsection'>
	The 'Search' section lets you search all launchers/directories for text inside
	 the file contents. All results can be viewed or modified the same way, as if you
	 were looking at them from the 'Items' or 'Dirs' list.
	</p>

	<!-- Note to previous users -->
	<p>
	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note to users:</span><br/>
	Massive changes have been made since 2.5.4 due to errors stemming from gmenu and
	 porting to other environments. I apologize to anyone who had trouble using
	 <strong>Menu Props</strong> and I will continue to iron out any bugs that may
	 still exist. If you have a menuprops.conf it would be better to remove it and
	 any other <strong>Menu Props</strong> files, and start fresh. Please report any
	 problems to <span class='wp-address'>cj@welbornprod.com</span>.s

<!-- Installation -->
<div class="wp-block feature-list">
	<div class="title-box">
		<h3 class='title' id='installation'>Installation:</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		Installation notes are in a file called 'installation-notes.txt' inside the
		 package. Basically, I made an install &amp; uninstall shell script that copies
		 the necessary files to the appropriate location. To run it, open a terminal,
		 'cd' to the /menupropsX.X.X directory, and type: <br />
		[code]sudo ./install[?code]<br />
		If you do not wish to install the application you can always try it first by
		 opening a terminal, 'cd' to the /menupropsX.X.X directory, and type: <br />
		[code]./menuprops[?code]<br />
		The install script just ensures that a <strong>Menu Props</strong> icon gets
		 placed in the applications menu, and that the icon, desktop file, launch script,
		 etc. are placed in their correct directory. If 'install', 'uninstall', or
		 'menuprops' fails to run be sure that they are set to executable using
		 [code]sudo chmod a+x [script name][?code]. The 'helper script', <strong>Menu
		 Props Writer</strong>, needs root privileges due to the directories
		 <strong>Menu Props</strong> must access. You will be need to know root's
		 password.

	</div>
	<p>
		There are still a few bugs in this version that I am currently working to fix.
		 I'll list them here as a warning. I have tested <strong>Menu Props</strong>
		 with several different desktop environments, under several different distros of
		 Linux. If any bugs occur, or you wish to port <strong>Menu Props</strong> to
		 your favorite environment, please send me a line at <span class='wp-address'>cj@welbornprod.com</span>
		 with your current Linux distribution &amp; Desktop Environment name/version. I
		 will try my best to correct the issue if possible.
	</p>
	<ul class="circle red">
		<li>
		<strong>KDE</strong> does not move items up or down. <strong>KDE</strong>
		 uses an alphabetical listing as the default, so trying to move items up or
		 down may not affect the Main Menu. (Even if it shows up in
		 <strong>Menu Props</strong>.)
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Cinnamon</strong> does not display sub-menus. This is
		 <strong>Cinnamon's</strong> design, not mine. Any sub-menus created
		 will show their items in either the "Other" menu, or the parent menu. I
		 discourage the use of sub-menus in the <strong>Cinnamon</strong> environment.
		</li>
		<li>
		Setting <strong>OnlyShowIn</strong> causes items to disappear from
		 <strong>Menu Props</strong> on certain systems, with certain
		 values set. (<span class='I'>Setting OnlyShowIn=KDE;
		 using KDE will cause this.</span>) I believe this is a limitation of
		 <strong>gmenu</strong> (<span class='I'>gnome-menus</span>),
		 which <strong>Menu Props</strong> is built with. I am currently working to
		 remove this dependency (see <span class='I'>Future</span>).
		 To fix items that have disappeared: Open the launcher from the "Items" tab,
		 and remove the OnlyShowIn option.
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Some systems don't have gmenu</strong> - Some systems need a little help
		 to get gmenu going, here is some good info on
		 how to get it for your system. (<span class='I'>
		 instructions are for <strong>Fedora</strong>, but it works for
		<strong>Slackware</strong>. It may work on other systems too.</span>):

	</ul>
	<!-- Warning about duplicates -->
	<p>
	** If <strong>Menu Props</strong> shows duplicates this may not be a bug.
	 <strong>Menu Props</strong> will always show duplicates for certain
	 applications, this is by design. For example, Konqueror shows duplicate
	 entries in <strong>Menu Props</strong>, but not in the Main Menu. This is by
	 Konqueror's design, not mine. They register several launchers with different
	 file/url types. Several other applications do this also. It's not an
	 <strong>actual duplicate</strong> unless the launcher .desktop files show the
	 <strong>exact same</strong> name. Always check the launcher's .desktop file
	 name, if they're slightly different then it's not a bug.<br/><br/>

		Except for possible bug-fix releases, <strong>Menu Props</strong> is frozen
		 until the completion of the next project ("<strong>unimenu</strong>",
		 <span class='I'>working title</span>). This project aims to
		 do at least two things. The first is to rid <strong>Menu Props</strong> of its
		 <strong>gmenu</strong>-dependency, and the second is to provide an open-source
		 freedesktop.org compliant module for python. At the start of the <strong>Menu
		 Props</strong> project I quickly realized that there were few options for
		 editing menus in python, especially if you are targeting multiple desktop
		 environments. Gmenu was made for Gnome, and is not guaranteed to work for other
		 environments. It's actually not guaranteed to work at all (specifically states
		 that API's may change, and cannot be held accountable for changes that break
		 applications). Now that I have a better understanding of how freedesktop.org
		 works, I believe I can write a reliable module to be used in <strong>Menu
		 Props</strong> or any other menu-related project for python. I will update
		 <strong>Menu Props</strong> and this site as the project progresses.
