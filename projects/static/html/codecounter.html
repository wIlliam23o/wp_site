	<p>
		A Python script I wrote to count various lines in my scripts. This script counts up all the code, 
		comment, &amp; blank lines. It also counts inline-comments, classes, functions, ifs, trys, and 
		some more things. It has the ability to list all imports, variables, caught exceptions, and 
		docstrings. This was one of my first projects, and I may have went overboard a little, but some 
		of this is valuable information to have. I still use this script when I'm making bigger projects, 
		to keep track of my percentage of comments to code (which <strong>CodeCounter</strong> displays. 
		It will display all totals by default, but can be told to display only the basic totals 
		(Total Lines, Code, Comment, Blank, DocString) using the -t flag. Anyway, here's codecount.py.

			Updates
		</h3>
	</div>
	
	<span class="update-title">
		Update: version 2.0.1
	</span>
	<p>
		fixed small re-factoring error in printreport()...
	</p>
	<span class="update-title">
		Update: version 2.0
	</span>
	<p>
		Completely refactored code! Module is now importable, and can be used like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="python">
import codecount
cc = codecount.codecounter()
myresults = cc.filechecker("myscript_to_check.py")
cc.printtotals(myresults)
cc.printimports(myresults)
	</pre>
	<p>
		...if directory is passed to main() codecount.py will print seperate results for all .py files found.<br/>
		...new printing style, use -t to print only the basic totals for a file.
	</p>
	
	<span class="update-title">
		Update: version 1.8
	</span>
	<p>
		Fixed import detection, now recognizes all import styles like:
	</p>
	<pre class="python">
import sys
import sys,os,re
import pango as p
from sys import *
from sys import path,platform
	</pre>
	<span class="update-title">
		Update: version 1.6
	</span>
	<p>
		Fixed DocString handling, now works better. Recognizes DocStrings like:
	</p>
	<pre class="python">
""" This is my Doc String """
	</pre>
	<p>
		-or-
	</p>
	<pre class="python">
"""
This is my DocString
"""
	</pre>
	<p>
		...also has the ability to list all DocStrings found with the -s argument. 
		(You might want to use -sd if you want the list to make sense)
	</p>
	
	<span class="update-title">
		Update: version 1.5
	</span>
	<p>
		CodeCounter works on single files, or whole directories. It looks for .py files to analyze 
		them and generates a report with a total from all the files. It can now handle Doc Strings, 
		"Quote Comments",  and multiple variable declarations on the same line. Better error handling 
		was added, and overall performance was improved.

			Usage
		</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		This script was designed using Linux (<a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" title="LinuxMint.com">Linux Mint</a>), 
		but will also work for <a href="http://www.windows.com" target="_blank" title="Windows.com">Windows</a>. 
		Obviously you must have <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank" title="Python.org">Python</a> installed, 
		if you do not have python installed you may find instructions on how to download it 
		<a href="http://www.python.org/download/" target="_blank" title="Python.org">here</a>. 
		To run the script locate your python executable (python.exe, or pythonw.exe in Windows, 
		/usr/bin/python in Linux) and run it like this (Linux method shown):
	</p>
	<pre class='bash'>
python /directory/codecount.py [-hitvesd] script_file_to_analyze.py
OR:
python /directory/codecount.py [-hitvesd] /directory/with/pyfiles

		That's about it, I hope this script helps you in some way. For anyone wanting to learn about <strong>string parsing</strong> 
		or basic <strong>python syntax</strong> like the <strong>if</strong> statement, <strong>list</strong> objects, 
		or <strong>file</strong> input, this might be a good script to look at and learn from.<br/>
