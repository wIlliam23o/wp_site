[Django] site for [welbornprod.com]...


It features a blog app I made to suit my needs, projects, web applications,
and miscellaneous scripts that I've written for one reason or another.


I wasn't able to find many pre-made 'apps' to do exactly what I wanted,
so I ended up making my own. I admit that most of these apps couldn't be
'dropped into' another project without bringing the 'wp_main' app and some
other stuff with it, but it was made for me, not everyone else. Sorry.


At the least, maybe someone could take inspiration from the apps, or modify them
to work with their setup.
